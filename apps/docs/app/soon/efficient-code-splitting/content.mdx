# Efficient Code Splitting

I’m currently working on making **tiptap-extension-twemoji** more lightweight and modular.  
The plan includes:

- ✂️ **Separating Shortcodes and Emoticon Logic**  
  This allows projects to only import what they need, instead of pulling everything in at once.

- 📦 **Optimized Bundle Size**  
  By splitting sources into smaller parts, developers can ship smaller, faster bundles.

- ⚡ **Better Performance**  
  Less unused code → quicker load times and improved efficiency.
